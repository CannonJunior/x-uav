### Initial Project Setup - UAV Comparison Web Application

**Prompt:**
First, create a PROMPTS.md file that documents every prompt entered into this project. Memoize this decision, all prompts to Claude Code get appended to PROMPTS.md. This project is a web application for the purpose of comparing different unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Search the web for all known UAVs that have been produced for government purposes, starting with these sources:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle
- https://www.japcc.org/chapters/c-uas-introduction/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_combat_aerial_vehicle

We will begin by populating a table display of all UAVs and their associated fields in this web application. Start with example data (MQ-9 Reaper specifications) and expand the fields based on research.

**Objectives:**
1. Create PROMPTS.md for documentation
2. Research government UAVs from provided sources
3. Design data model based on MQ-9 Reaper example data
4. Plan table display implementation
5. Plan for future visual features:
   - Accurate imagery of aerial vehicles
   - Overhead silhouettes (accurately scaled)
   - 3D models with rotation capability

**Status:** In Progress
